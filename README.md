# TwitterScrape of Melbourne Car-Attack
My CW2 Coding and Analytics assignment for Digital Sandbox-course @Goldsmiths MA in Digital Journalism

I used Jupyter Notebook to first scrape Twitter with python-code and later to used python to clean and analyze the data. All that coding is available in the python-code found in the .ipynb-file.
